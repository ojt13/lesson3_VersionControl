            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control is a main repository for all of the files in a project. It leaves a spot for the team members to look at files, make changes or edits, and then check them back in. this solves the file sharing problem that we have.  A version control system automatically notes things like who changed files, when these files were changed, what was different about them, and then merges changes to the same file. This is a system that is good for companies with many different authors, because there is a way that you can change files and see is changing and editing them.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">What are the version control system benefits?</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There are many different benefits to using version control systems. One of the benefits is that the files cannot be overwritten. This is beneficial because you wont lose any files. Another benefit is that there is a common repository that holds all of the most recent files, along with this, people can all work simultaneously without any issues. You can switch back to an older version of a file of a project you are working on if you need to, and your files will always backup. This is great for people working on teams because they can all do their own part without running into issues.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Repositories</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There are two different types of repositories that are used in version control. A remote repository is the first one. A remote repository is located on the remote server that is shared with more than one team member. This is the server that all members of the team know and use. A local repository is the one that resides on a local machine of an individual user. There are two ways to create a local repository. The first way is to create brand new one, or you can clone an existing remote repository onto your local machine. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">GIT “is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handles everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency” GIT is an awesome resource because it Is very easy to use and learn how to use. Is has a very tiny footprint, but is lightening fast performance. There are many different reasons why you should use GIT. One reason is that every user has a complete copy of the repository on their own local machine. Processes always run much faster, and there is no single point of failure. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">GIT Commands</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">GIT runs off of a terminal as does things like java and similar languages. There are different commands and these commands all mean different things. These commands must be very specific and they will only do what you want them to do if they are correct.  One example of these commands is “git log,” this shows all of the back ups produced in the repository. Another example of a command is “git status.” Git status will show all of the files that were changed or edited since the last time is were backed up and which files were already added to the staging area. These are just a couple of examples of the many different git commands that are used. </p>
